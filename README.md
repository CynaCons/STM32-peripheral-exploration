# STM32-peripheral-exploration
I am building software components for the peripherals that I own using my STM32. 

These components must be:
* Easily added / removed from the projets
* Not too hard to understand
* Well maintained and commented
* Using the most simple design approach


Currenty the component tree is the following (hardware name -- component name)
* dht22 -- dht22
